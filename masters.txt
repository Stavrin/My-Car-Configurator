where did they start it from 

is there chance to learn vr development


been shut out

This Skills Bootcamp is for anyone who has a
dream to work in a passion industry - but has
been locked out because of money, no
connections, no support, or simply life
commitments. Self-paced, with a mentor, online
- now the only thing that matters is your talent
and effort.‚Äù


On the right track to finish it without too much more time, and will do so, got carried away with the previous/next buttons functionality and spent too long on that. First time using the UI buttons so there was some new learning involved too.

Was more precious about the UI layout at the start.

(previous next numbers dont work properly,
price gets messed up if you change cars, need to do same array system with car price or something)

Make vid of extra bits and add on tmoro.
